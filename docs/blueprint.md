# **App Name**: GraphQL Vision

## Core Features:

- Environment Configuration: Allows users to configure and manage different GraphQL environments (Dev, Staging, Production, etc.) by specifying the GraphQL endpoint URL, headers, and authentication details.
- GraphQL Query Editor: Offers a powerful editor for writing GraphQL queries, mutations, and subscriptions with features such as syntax highlighting, auto-completion, code formatting, and error detection.
- Schema Explorer: Enables users to explore GraphQL schemas with a tree view and full-text search. Displays types, fields, arguments, descriptions, deprecation notices, and directives.
- Response Handling: Provides a response viewer with JSON tree view, raw JSON, table view, and chart view, including response metadata such as status code, response time, and headers. Additionally, it suggests common validation approaches with AI tool that uses the information provided about expected response to provide validation approaches and/or other quality assesments for response received.
- Query History: Automatically saves executed queries in history, allowing users to search, filter, and restore queries with associated metadata.
- Collections/Saved Queries: Organize and manage GraphQL queries by categorizing by saving and categorizing into collections and folders with associated metadata such as name, description, and tags. Allows to import from JSON, Postman or Insomnia collections.
- Settings and Preferences: Allows customization for UI Preferences to adjust editor settings (font size, tab size, word wrap, line height), adjust default timeout, adjust theme, enable or disable animations, and allow other types of customizations for overall experience.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated blue (#4285F4), evokes feelings of trust, reliability, and clarity, crucial for a developer tool; provides strong contrast with both light and dark background schemes.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F5F5F5) for light mode, very dark gray (#1E1E1E) for dark mode, nearly identical hues, provides a neutral backdrop to ensure readability.
- Accent color: Green (#34A853), an analogous color, to indicate success states (successful query execution or validation) while contrasting enough to stand out.
- Font: 'Poppins', a sans-serif font known for its clean lines and legibility, making it perfect for both code and UI text in a tool where clarity is essential.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro', a monospaced font which optimizes the legibility of the GraphQL syntax.
- The layout should feature flexible panels that can be resized and collapsed, allowing users to customize their workspace. A three-column layout with an explorer, query editor, and response viewer is suggested, as this setup is ideal for usability.
- Subtle transitions and loading states provide visual feedback to the user, which creates a more engaging experience.
